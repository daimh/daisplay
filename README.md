#### Overview
A Raspbian Lite-based signage. 


It plays multiple h264 videos simutaneously, shows time, weather and bus information, changes background at user-specified interval. It also supports user's own addon. U of Michigan's Magic Bus, AAATA bus, and weather were implemented in addon as an example. 

Tested on Raspberry Pi 3 Model B at 1080p resolution, and Pi 4 with one 4k resolution display.

#### Installation
* prepare

prepare a Raspbian Lite image on a SD card, boot it, login as user 'pi', and adjust timezone.

* step 1

```
	$ cd /home/pi
	$ sudo apt install git
	$ git clone https://github.com/daimh/daisplay.git
	$ sudo ln -s /home/pi/daisplay/etc/daisplay.conf /etc/
	$ sudo /home/pi/daisplay/usr/lib/daisplay/bin/daisplay-init-step-1
	$ sudo shutdown -r now
```

* step 2

```
	$ sudo /home/pi/daisplay/usr/lib/daisplay/bin/daisplay-init-step-2
	$ sudo shutdown -r now
```

#### Customization 
* to show realtime weather, get a free appkey from <https://openweathermap.org/api> and put it in /etc/daisplay.conf
* copy multiple background png images to /home/pi/daisplay/var/lib/daisplay/background/. You can even dynamically generate png images in that directory.
* copy h264 format videos files to var/lib/daisplay/video-X1-Y1-X2-Y2-DESCRIPTION/, only 1080p is supported as omxplayer has such a limitation even on Pi 4
* to adjust the video window location, change X1, Y1, X2, Y2 in those video directory names
* command 'png2h264' can convert multiple png files to a h264 video for smooth slideshow
* convert other video format to h264  
	`$ mencoder example.mpg -ovc x264 -x264encopts preset=medium -o example.h264`
* embed subtitle file into a video  
	`$ mencoder example.mpg -ovc x264 -x264encopts preset=medium -sub Market.srt -subfont-text-scale 3 -o example.h264`
* reduce video resolution, as Pi 3 is not powerful enough to play multiple 1080p videos.  
	`$ mencoder large.h264 -ovc x264 -x264encopts preset=medium -vf scale=960:540 -o small.h264`

#### Package and install your own customzation
	$ /home/pi/daisplay/usr/lib/daisplay/bin/daisplay-dpkg-deb
	# copy the deb file to a new Raspbian Lite, log in to the new Pi
	$ sudo apt install ./daisplay_custom.deb
	$ sudo /usr/lib/daisplay/bin/daisplay-init-step-1
	$ sudo shutdown -r now
	$ sudo /usr/lib/daisplay/bin/daisplay-init-step-2
	$ sudo shutdown -r now
